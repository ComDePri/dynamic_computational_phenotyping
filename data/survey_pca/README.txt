These CSV files for the exogenous variables (after PCA) were generated by:

/net/rcstorenfs02/ifs/rc_labs/gershman_lab/users/Stan/1_code/shared_code/matlab_code/dynamical_system/mle/save_exo_PCA_as_csv_files.m

Note that there we z-score the data, run PCA and change the sign of the PC scores and coefficients to match our labels (valence, arousal and self-control).
We do not z-score the values again after that.
We provide the survey data in two versions:
1. Averaged across all 3 sessions (not task-specific; exo_PC*.csv).
2. Task-specific (exo_day*.csv)
